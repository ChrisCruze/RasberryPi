# Overview
The objective of this readme is to spell out all the features the Raspberry Pi module will have, which will include remote control, battery monitoring via a dashboard. 

# Control Panel
The control panel will serve to control different units within the van, which will include the heater and maxair fann. These items need to be controlled so that it they can be triggered automatically from an Alexa command or from the press of a button. Ideally, the control panel is built with Electron so that it can look nice and be launched like an app. 

## MaxxAir Fan & Chinese Diesel Heater
The connection will be made via IR Signals since it is remote operated. 

## Overhead Lights, Strobe Lights, Water Pump
This connection can be made via a remote if we install one or direct connection to the fuse

## Inverter
There is a phone line that connects to the inverter


# Monitoring
Monitoring will also take place so that I can know the temperature, pressure, odometer reading. It will also be able to read and pick up signals from outside information since I will have an internet solution such as Wineguard or Togo to be able to provide internet access. 

## Temperature, Pressure, Humidity 

## Battery Percentage, Battery Consumed, Solar Generated

# Features

## Alexa Enabled

## Electron Dashboard

## Grafana, Prometheus, NodeExporter
This will monitor the overall state of the van
