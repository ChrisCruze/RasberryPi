# Overview
The objective of this readme is to spell out all the features the Raspberry Pi module will have, which will include remote control, battery monitoring via a dashboard. 

# Control Panel
The control panel will serve to control different units within the van, which will include the heater and maxair fann. These items need to be controlled so that it they can be triggered automatically from an Alexa command or from the press of a button. Ideally, the control panel is built with Electron so that it can look nice and be launched like an app. 


### Dashboard

1) Time
2) Temperature/Pressure, Humiditiy 
3) Battery Percentage & Remaining Battery & Solar Energy
4) Internet Speed and Wifi Consumption
5) Water Level

### Control Panel

1) Lights (incl. Bathroom Lights, Strobe Lights)
2) Temperature (Heater and MaxxAir Fann) - connection via IR signals
3) Security (Rear and 360 Camera)
4) Water Pump
5) Power (Inverter & 12v) - phone line connection
